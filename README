This archive contains programs for downloading and analyzing solar wind data from multiple spacecraft.
Detailed science information may be found at https://sites.google.com/a/cfa.harvard.edu/jakub-prchlik/home/shock-finding.
The directory structure is as follows:

cdf
---
Database of cdf files downloaded from ftp://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/data/. The except is SOHO CELIAS, which is currently done manually. 

code
----
Programs that analyze solar Wind discontinuities. 
The primary programs have the following functionality:
Find discontinuities given jumps in plasma parameters,
match time offsets for a single discontinuity between four L1 spacecraft,
and match time offsets continously for four L1 spacecraft and predict planar arrival time at THEMIS/ARTEMIS spacecraft.

comb_data
---------
Old, contained merged Wind, ACE, and SOHO data sets. Time resolution too low to be interesting.

html_files
---------
Files containing summaries of spacecraft event discontinuities observed in wind and the time offsets with the other 3 L1 spacecraft.
